# Blog System Implementation

## Overview
The blog system has been completely refactored to use real Firebase data instead of mock data. Users can now create, edit, delete, and view blog posts with full CRUD functionality.

## Features Implemented

### Admin Blog Management (`/admin/blog`)
- ✅ **Create new blog posts** with title, excerpt, content, author, category, tags, read time, and publish status
- ✅ **Edit existing blog posts** with full form validation
- ✅ **Delete blog posts** with confirmation dialog
- ✅ **Toggle publish status** between draft and published
- ✅ **Image upload** to Firebase Storage
- ✅ **Search and filter** by title, excerpt, author, category, and status
- ✅ **Sample data seeding** button to populate the system with initial blog posts
- ✅ **Real-time data** from Firebase Firestore

### Public Blog Display (`/blog`)
- ✅ **Display published blog posts** only (drafts are hidden)
- ✅ **Search functionality** across title, excerpt, and author
- ✅ **Category filtering** with predefined wellness categories
- ✅ **Sorting options** by date, title, or author
- ✅ **Featured post** display for the most recent published post
- ✅ **Responsive grid layout** for blog post cards

### Individual Blog Post Pages (`/blog/[slug]`)
- ✅ **Dynamic routing** based on blog post slugs
- ✅ **Full content display** with HTML rendering
- ✅ **Related posts** suggestions
- ✅ **Meta information** display (author, date, read time, category)
- ✅ **Featured image** support

## Technical Implementation

### Firebase Integration
- **Firestore Database**: Stores blog post data with proper timestamps
- **Firebase Storage**: Handles image uploads for blog post featured images
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses Firebase listeners for live data updates

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  id?: string;
  title: string;
  excerpt: string;
  content: string;
  author: string;
  publishDate: Date;
  tags: string[];
  category: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  isPublished: boolean;
  slug: string;
  readTime: number;
  createdAt?: any;
  updatedAt?: any;
}
```

### Key Services
- `blogService`: Handles all CRUD operations for blog posts
- `imageService`: Manages image uploads to Firebase Storage
- `seedBlogData`: Provides sample data for testing

## How to Use

### 1. Initial Setup
1. Navigate to `/admin/blog`
2. Click the "Add Sample Data" button to populate the system with initial blog posts
3. This will create 3 sample posts for testing

### 2. Creating a New Blog Post
1. Click "New Blog Post" button
2. Fill in all required fields:
   - Title (required)
   - Excerpt (required)
   - Content (required) - supports HTML formatting
   - Author (required)
   - Category (required)
   - Tags (comma-separated)
   - Read time in minutes
   - Featured image (optional)
   - Publish status
3. Click "Create Post"

### 3. Managing Blog Posts
- **Edit**: Click the edit icon to modify existing posts
- **Delete**: Click the delete icon to remove posts
- **Toggle Status**: Click the publish status to switch between draft/published
- **View**: Click the eye icon to preview posts

### 4. Viewing Blog Posts
- **Public Blog**: Visit `/blog` to see all published posts
- **Individual Posts**: Click on any blog post to view the full article
- **Search & Filter**: Use the search bar and category filters to find specific content

## Content Guidelines

### HTML Content Support
The blog system supports HTML formatting in the content field:
- `<h2>`, `<h3>` for headings
- `<p>` for paragraphs
- `<ul>`, `<li>` for lists
- `<strong>`, `<em>` for emphasis
- `<br>` for line breaks

### Image Guidelines
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF
- Recommended size: 1200x800 pixels
- Images are automatically optimized and stored in Firebase Storage

### Slug Generation
- Slugs are automatically generated from the title
- Format: lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces, no special characters
- Example: "Yoga for Beginners" → "yoga-for-beginners"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Posts not loading**: Check Firebase connection and Firestore rules
2. **Image upload fails**: Verify Firebase Storage permissions
3. **Slug conflicts**: The system automatically adds timestamps to ensure uniqueness

### Firebase Rules
Make sure your Firestore rules allow read/write access to the `blog_posts` collection for authenticated users.
